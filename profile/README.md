### üòé Declaration
Founded in **2023**, our company is built on the belief that the key to effective learning lies in the compatibility between student and teacherüè´. We understand that a common challenge in education is the sentiment of **‚ÄúGa cocok sama gurunya,‚Äù** an Indonesian phrase that translates to **‚Äúnot compatible with the teacher.‚Äù**  
  
Our innovative solution is a matchmaking platform that pairs students and teachers based on their personalities. By ensuring a harmonious match, **we aim to enhance the learning process, making it more engaging, productive, and enjoyable for both parties.üí•** Our goal is to redefine the educational landscape by placing personality compatibility at the heart of learning.  

### üèÜ Ambition  
Our mission is to revolutionize the learning experience by bridging the gap between students and tutors through a unique, personalized approach. We have developed a mobile application that allows students to rent tutors, not just based on their academic qualifications, but also their personalities.  
  
We believe that a harmonious student-teacher relationship is crucial for effective learning. To achieve this, we employ various recommendation system algorithms in our machine learning model. This advanced technology analyzes the personalities of both students and teachers, and matches them based on compatibility.  
  
In essence, we are not just an educational platform; we are a community that values personal connections and mutual understanding. By fostering these meaningful relationships, we aim to make learning more engaging, enjoyable, and ultimately, more successful. Our goal is to create a world where everyone can say, ‚ÄúI am compatible with my teacher.‚Äù
